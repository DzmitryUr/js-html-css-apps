The repository contains code for simple JS/HTML/CSS Apps.
Each project was built from scratch during the recording of the YouTube video. The video usually contains a short introduction, a review of the design, defining HTML structure and CSS styles, and applying JS code.
Provided exercises can help improve Web Development skills, get an understanding of how to code in JavaScript, and prepare for the Frontend interview.
